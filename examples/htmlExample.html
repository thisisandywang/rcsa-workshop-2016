	<h1>WOW THIS IS SUCH IMPORTANT TITLE </h1>
	<h2> This is, like, a subtitle </h2>
	<h3> you get the idea! </h3>
	<h6> pretty sure this is smaller than the actual text.. </h6>
	<!-- <img src="img/headExample.jpeg"> -->

			<p> This is where you would begin writing important things about yourself... I'm going to try to fill this space a bit to make it look more full, more realistic, closer to an actual website. If this were a professional one, I could have my elevator pitch here, like "Born in such and such, a whatever year at this university studying something awesome. Wants to be a succcessful career kind of person and enjoys long walks on the beach" Good thing this isn't professional at all 
			</p>

		<div> This is like its own little bubble. If I wanted to change this font or this color or something, but none of my other professional stuff, I could add an id name and change it in css or just add a style tag within the div. Let's look at that! 
		</div>

		<div style="color:red"> Wow this is so cool and different, a div ~woah~
			<p> These words don't have their own specified style... so will they be black or red? (hint... they're inside the div space... so they're gonna be red...)</p>
			<p style="color:blue"> but what about this paragraph? Well it's inside the div so....it should be red? lol jk there's a hierarchy and the innermosted nested thing overwrites the out its nested so that new color (blue) overwrites the div color (red)</p> 
			<p> but here's a new paragraph and it's red again </p> 
		</div>

		<p> we're done with that div now. If we wanted to potentially move it or shrink it or do whatever the hell to it, we turn to CSS and it will be super easy to change it, make it whatever want. makes it easier. Also I'm just going to add a <span style="color:green"> span here, which will change things, but only these specific things that I want to change</span> now im out of it <span style="color:green"> now im back in it... </span> and if I wanted to change these like random 10 words in the paragraph but none of the other ones, I'd go to CSS again and make the span tag do something. for now I'll change it in the html tag just to help you <strong> visualize </strong>. WOAH how did that happen??? ^^^. I'll tell you how, the strong tag! You open it, type what you want to be bolded, and then close it, yay!</p>

		<p> wow so much boring text. Let's insert a link! simply open with the "a" tag and give it a reference to go to with the href tag <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"> This is a hyperlink to facebook now! </a></p> 
		<p> Let's insert a photo! Make it interesting! We're going to use the img tag which is weird because it's the only tag that doesn't need a closing tag with the same name... lets try it! <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nHbtVSF675E/UY60lQBXabI/AAAAAAAAAJg/TmLiYAL8PxI/s1600/smiling-baby-images+(15).jpg"> This is my favorite picture of a smiling baby on the internet -Camille</p>
		<p> Yay okay now lets try to link to a url WITH A PHOTO AHHH I'm going to link this picture of people laughing to gradescope because gradescope is a joke lolol <a href="https://gradescope.com/"><img src="http://bpisecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/People-Laughing.jpg"></a>

		<div> okay I'm making a new div for the purpose of lists. Let's learn those now. There are two kinds essentially, ordered lists and unordered lists. Make sure you open and close your tag of the kind you want then put as many list item tags you want in between those.
			<ul> THIS IS UNORDERED
				<li> Seven </li>
				<li>Two </li>
				<li> Forty Three </li>
			</ul>
			<ol> THIS IS ORDERED
				<li> Two </li>
				<li> Seven </li>
				<li> Forty Three </li>
			</ol> Very simple. Note that we could change the font of the size of this list or whatever using css and tagging the ol or ul tag.
