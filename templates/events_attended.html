<!--
    Make sure all your content is within a column. Every column is placed within a row. A row must be within a container.
    See the home page for an example of how this is done.

    We do this because bootstrap has a grid system that takes care of all the nitty-gritty margin and padding details.

    We are working with a 12 column grid, so make sure all your components fit within the 12-column grid. Don't try to
    make a row with 13+ columns. If you need more space, make another row.

    For more information about bootstrap's grid system, see: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid
